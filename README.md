# DataExxtractionAlgorithm
I have created and implemented a randomised data extraction algorithm used to assign a new word which is trending on the web to a particular group or category or dictionary.

This is inspired by the online hiring problem http://theory.stanford.edu/~sergei/slides/hiring-dagstuhl.pdf

â€¢	Performance Analysis- This algorithm reduced the time required to recognize a new word in the Twitter Dataset by 14.31% with a trade-off on accuracy. Language: Java
